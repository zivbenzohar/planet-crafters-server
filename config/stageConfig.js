/**
 * Stage completion target configuration.
 *
 * TARGET_BY_LEVEL maps difficulty level (1-5) to the minimum number of
 * matching edge connections a player needs to complete a stage.
 *
 * These values were calibrated against the Greedy Agent simulator so that
 * the resulting Success Rates fall within each level's SR window:
 *
 *   Level 1 (90-100% SR) →  50 connections  (~97 % SR)
 *   Level 2 (65-80%  SR) →  54 connections  (~74 % SR)
 *   Level 3 (40-60%  SR) →  57 connections  (~45 % SR)
 *   Level 4 (20-35%  SR) →  59 connections  (~27 % SR)
 *   Level 5 ( 5-15%  SR) →  61 connections  (~10 % SR)
 *
 * Calibrated for the shuffle-simulation model: each greedy sim shuffles the
 * 30-tile deck before play, so SR measures the fraction of draw-order
 * permutations that lead to a win.  Targets were measured empirically over
 * 3 × 1 000 shuffled simulations of random catalog decks.
 *
 * DEFAULT_TARGET (20) is kept as a legacy fallback for stages that have not
 * yet been assigned a difficulty level.
